# Inconsistent Gradient Rendering in Tailwind CSS across Browsers

This repository demonstrates an issue with the rendering of Tailwind CSS gradients across different browsers.  In some instances, the gradient may not render correctly, instead showing a solid color. This inconsistency can lead to unexpected visual differences in applications built with Tailwind CSS.

## Bug Description
The problem lies in the inconsistent implementation of CSS gradients across various browsers.  While Tailwind CSS provides convenient classes for generating gradients, the actual rendering depends on the browser's interpretation of the CSS. This can result in the gradient not appearing as expected or rendering as a solid color instead.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js` which contains the code snippet using Tailwind CSS gradient classes.
3. Test the application on different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).  Observe the differences in gradient rendering.

## Solution
The solution provided in `bugSolution.js` addresses the inconsistent rendering by ensuring that the gradient is explicitly defined using a fallback mechanism.  This involves using linear-gradient with fallback color values to prevent unexpected rendering issues.
